fintp_ws
========

Request/response serialization library for **FinTP**

Requirements
------------
- Xerces-C

Build instructions
------------------
- On Unix-like systems, **fintp_ws** uses the GNU Build System (Autotools) so we first need to generate the configuration script using:


        autoreconf -fi
Now we must run: 

        ./configure
        make
- For Windows, a Visual Studio 2010 solution is provided.
